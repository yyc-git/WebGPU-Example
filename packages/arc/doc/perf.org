* how to optimize compute shader?

- switch

If many threads in an warp run different parts of the switch they'll be masked and won't run in parallel. This means you might be losing some time there. 

I would try to build a volume that only has one type of voxel and remove the switch to test if that's the bottleneck.



- samples the texture the minimal amount(gpu memory access)
